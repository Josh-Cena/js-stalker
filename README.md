# JS stalker

What's happening inside your JS objects?

This is an experiment to let the JS engine log what it is doing at each step of the "intrinsic methods".

## Usage

```bash
yarn install
yarn stalk array
```

Or simply read src/array/output.log.

Currently the array methods have got the most attention, but I plan to stalk other methods as well.
